Microaggressions are the everyday slights or insults which communicate negative messages to target individuals, often based upon their marginalized group membership. Over time, microaggressions can take a great toll on mental and emotional health, and the target’s feeling of belonging in science and academia. The following examples can all be labeled micro-aggressions:⛔ Commenting on a woman’s appearance rather than her work;⛔ Only directing questions at male colleagues when there are female experts in the room;⛔ Telling someone of colour that they “speak such good English”;⛔ Forcefully praising meat to an individual with a vegetarian diet;⛔ Praising alcoholic drinks to an individual who do not consume them.⛔ Exclusion from a group can be a common nonverbal form of microaggression.⛔ Microaggressions can be couched in the form of a “compliment,” (e.g. “you’re too attractive to be a scientist”).","type":"content","url":"/coc#microaggressions","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Code of Conduct","lvl2":"Respecting differences"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/coc#respecting-differences","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Code of Conduct","lvl2":"Respecting differences"},"content":"Participants come from many cultures and backgrounds.

Unfortunately, most students are not brought into contact with the respective issues during their studies and thus quite often perceive the present inequalities as “normal” and a given. This lead to the proliferation of exceptionally unfair “standards” and practices towards minorities and underrepresented groups. What’s needed to combat these things are Universities, Departments, Lecturers, etc. that address these issues, as well as inform and enable students to actively engage in the process towards increasing \n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion (\n\n#DEI) at all levels.\n\nYou might think: “Why should I care and what does it have to do with me? I just want to study.”. Well, even though you might not be (knowingly) affected, someone you know most likely will be and it will take all of us to change this for the better.

Because teaching students via \n\nproprietary software is just not fair and won’t help anyone: students have to obtain licenses or use those from the university (which usually doesn’t have enough for everyone), leading to tremendous problems regarding inequity now and in the future. Additionally, \n\nopens-source software can do everything, if not more than \n\nproprietary software and is furthermore usually better supported, tested and documented, creating a fantastic sense of community.\n\nIn order to help you get all the software required for the course, a \n\ncomprehensive installation instruction was compiled.","type":"content","url":"/overview#how-do-i-get-all-the-software-and-do-i-have-to-apply-for-a-loan-to-get-it","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Course overview & procedure","lvl4":"Where is everything?","lvl3":"Gimme the details","lvl2":"list of content chapter"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/overview#where-is-everything","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Course overview & procedure","lvl4":"Where is everything?","lvl3":"Gimme the details","lvl2":"list of content chapter"},"content":"All course materials (lecture slides, lecture demo notebooks, lab notebooks, homework assignments, etc.) will be available on the \n\ncourse website, i.e. the one you’re looking at right now.

These guidelines are to help you get your question answered as quickly as possible and to ensure that we’re able to get to everyone’s questions.\n\nIf you have:\n\n- questions about course content - these are awesome! We want everyone to see them and have their questions answered too, so either use the \n\nhypothes.is plugin, the discord channel, e-mail or the \n\nGitHub repository.\n\n- a technical assignment question - come to office hours (after making an appointment) or use the provided communication platform to reach out (e.g. discord, slack etc.). Answering technical questions is often best accomplished ‘in person’ where we can discuss the question and talk through ideas. Be as specific as you can in the question you ask (and include error messages when appropriate!). And, for those answering, help your classmates as much as you can without just giving the answer. Help guide them, point them in a direction, provide pseudo code, but do not provide code that answers assignment questions.\n\n- been stuck on something for a while (>30min) and aren’t even really sure where to start - Programming can be frustrating and it may not always be obvious what is going wrong or why something isn’t working. That’s OK - we’ve all been there! IF you are stuck, you can and should reach out for help, even if you aren’t exactly sure what your specific question is. To determine when to reach out, consider the 2-hour rule. This rule states that if you are stuck, work on that problem for an hour. Then, take a 30 minute break and do something else. When you come back after your break, try for another 30 minutes or so to solve your problem. If you are still completely stuck, stop and contact us (office hours, post on discord). If you don’t have a specific question, include the information you have (what you’re stuck on, the code you’ve been trying that hasn’t been happening, and/or the error messages you’ve been getting).\n\n- questions about course logistics - first, check the \n\noverview & \n\nsyllabus. If you can’t find the answer there, first ask a classmate.\n\n- something super cool to share related to class or want to talk about a topic in further depth - feel free to post on discord, contact the instructors or come to office hours.\n\n- some feedback about the course you want to share anonymously - If you’ve been offended by an example in class, really liked or disliked a lesson, or wish there were something covered in class that wasn’t but would rather not share this publicly, etc., please fill out the anonymous \n\nGoogle Form*\n\n*This form can be taken down at any time if it’s not being used for its intended purpose; however, you all will be notified should that happen.","type":"content","url":"/overview#how-to-get-your-question-s-answered-and-or-provide-feedback","position":41},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Course overview & procedure","lvl3":"Acknowledgements","lvl2":"list of content chapter"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/overview#acknowledgements","position":42},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Course overview & procedure","lvl3":"Acknowledgements","lvl2":"list of content chapter"},"content":"Several parts of this section are directly taken or adapted from \n\nAlexander Huth’s Neuro Data Analysis in Python syllabus licensed under a \n\nBSD-3-Clause License and \n\nShannon Ellis’ COGS 18: Introduction to Python.","type":"content","url":"/overview#acknowledgements","position":43},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Setup for the course"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/setup","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Setup for the course"},"content":"There are a few things you need to get working on your machine in order to follow this course.
